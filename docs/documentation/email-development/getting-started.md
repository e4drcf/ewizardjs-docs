# :email: Getting started

## Preconditions

Before starting the development be sure that you have installing the latest version of eWizard CLI. More detail information about eWizard CLI installation are described here [link to Installation article].  

## Beginning of work

Firstly, create the folder which will store your emailâ€™s content. After that open a command prompt in the root of the created folder and run the following command: 
```
wiz init
```
This command will initialize a template you choose. For the email template development, you have to choose an email from the suggested menu.

     component
```
Also, you will be asked questions about directory where your project will be generated, description, name and author of the created email template. After successful initialization your project structure must have the same view as on the picture.

# :wrench: Settings

After creating a new template by ewizard CLI you have a possibility to view its basic settings. There are four types of templates which you can create using the **wiz init** command.

``` {2}
? Choose template you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
   > email
     edetailer
     survey
     component
```

To view the file with settings go to the *template folder/.ewizard/settings.json* file.

## General settings

Every template's settings have the **_'content'_** object which stores the following fields:

* The **_'type'_** field contains an unique type for every template. By default, it is the name of the current template. 
* The **_'subtype'_** field is used only for email template. 

::: tip Note
In **survey** template are described only general settings.
